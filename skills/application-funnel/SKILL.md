# Application Funnel

Qualify leads before getting on the phone. Only talk to people who are a good fit.

## Flow

```
Traffic → Landing Page → Application Form → Calendar Booking → Confirmation
```

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Landing Page | Sell the transformation, not the product |
| Application Form | Qualify leads by budget, timeline, commitment |
| Calendar Booking | Qualified applicants book a call |
| Confirmation | Set expectations for the call |

## Application Form Questions (Recommended)

### Qualifying Questions
1. What's your current [revenue / situation / level]?
2. What's your #1 goal for the next 90 days?
3. What have you tried so far? What happened?
4. On a scale of 1–10, how committed are you to solving this?
5. If we can help you achieve [result], are you in a position to invest in yourself?

### Logistics
6. What's your budget range? (Multiple choice: $1K–$3K / $3K–$5K / $5K–$10K / $10K+)
7. When do you want to get started? (This week / This month / Just exploring)
8. What's the best phone number to reach you?

### Disqualification Triggers
- Budget below minimum threshold
- "Just exploring" with no urgency
- Commitment score below 7

## Landing Page Structure
1. **Bold outcome headline** — focus on the result, not the method
2. **"This is for you if…"** qualifier bullets
3. **"This is NOT for you if…"** disqualifier bullets
4. **Client results** — case studies with specific numbers
5. **The process** — 3-step overview of what working together looks like
6. **About section** — short credibility-focused bio
7. **CTA** — "Apply Now" (not "Buy Now" — it's exclusive)
8. **FAQ** — addressing process, time commitment, qualifications

# Challenge Funnel

Engage your audience with daily micro-wins over 3–7 days, then present your offer when momentum is highest.

## Flow

```
Registration → Daily Challenge Pages (3–7) → Offer Page → Thank You
```

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Registration | Capture email + add to challenge group |
| Day 1–X Pages | Daily training + action step |
| Offer Page | Present paid product (Day X+1 or final day) |
| Thank You | Confirm purchase, deliver access |

## Challenge Length Guide

| Duration | Best For | Engagement |
|---|---|---|
| 3 days | Quick wins, simple topics | Highest completion |
| 5 days | Mid-depth topics, skill building | Best balance |
| 7 days | Complex transformations | Deepest engagement |

## Daily Page Structure
1. **Day badge** ("Day 3 of 5")
2. **Daily theme/title** (e.g., "Create Your First Email Sequence")
3. **Training video** (10–20 min)
4. **Today's action step** — clear, specific, completable
5. **Completion CTA** ("Mark as Complete" / share in community)
6. **Preview of tomorrow** — builds anticipation

## Email Sequence

| Email | Timing | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Welcome | Immediately | Set expectations, build excitement |
| Day 1 Unlock | Morning, Day 1 | Link to Day 1 content |
| Day 1 Reminder | Evening, Day 1 | "Did you complete today's action?" |
| Day 2–X Unlock | Morning, each day | Daily content link |
| Midpoint Check-in | Mid-challenge | Celebrate progress, re-engage |
| Final Day | Morning, last day | Build up to the offer |
| Offer Email | After final training | Present the paid product |
| Offer Reminder | 24 hours later | Social proof + urgency |
| Cart Close | 48 hours after offer | "Last chance" |

## Conversion Benchmarks

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Registration rate | > 40% |
| Day 1 completion | > 70% |
| Day 3 completion | > 45% |
| Day 5 completion | > 30% |
| Challenge → offer page | > 50% of completers |
| Offer page → purchase | > 8% |
| Overall reg → purchase | > 3% |

## Key Principles
1. **Small daily wins** — each day should feel achievable in 15–30 min
2. **Community** — use a Facebook group, Discord, or Slack for accountability
3. **Show, don't just tell** — demonstrate results during the challenge
4. **Seed the offer** from Day 1 — mention the paid product naturally
5. **Celebrate completers** — social proof for the next cohort

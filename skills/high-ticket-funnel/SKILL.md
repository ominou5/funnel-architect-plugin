# High-Ticket Funnel

When the deal size justifies a sales conversation. Every element builds trust and qualifies.

## Flow

```
Authority Content → Long-Form Sales Page → Application/Booking → Sales Call → Onboarding
```

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Authority Content | Blog post, video, case study — warms cold traffic |
| Long-Form Sales Page | The main pitch — transformation, proof, process, offer |
| Application / Booking | Qualify + schedule the call |
| Onboarding | Post-purchase welcome, next steps |

## Long-Form Sales Page Structure

### Section Order (Proven)
1. **Headline** — bold transformation statement
2. **Opening story** — empathize with the reader's situation
3. **The problem** — articulate their pain better than they can
4. **The cost of inaction** — what happens if they don't solve this
5. **The solution** — introduce your approach (not the product yet)
6. **Case studies** (3–5) — detailed client transformations with numbers
7. **The offer** — what's included, how it works
8. **Who this is for / not for**
9. **About / credentials** — why you're qualified
10. **Investment frame** — ROI-focused, not cost-focused
11. **FAQ** — handle objections
12. **Final CTA** — "Apply Now" or "Book a Call"

## Case Study Template
```
CLIENT: [Name, Title]
SITUATION: [Where they were — specific numbers]
CHALLENGE: [What wasn't working]
SOLUTION: [What you did together]
RESULT: [Specific measurable outcomes]
TIMELINE: [How quickly results came]
QUOTE: "[In their own words]"
```

## Pricing Psychology for High-Ticket
- **Never show price on the page** — save it for the call
- **Frame as investment**: "Our clients typically see X return within Y months"
- **Payment plans**: Offer 3–6 month options to reduce resistance
- **ROI anchor**: "If this program helps you add just one extra $10K client, it pays for itself 3x over"

# E-Commerce Funnel

Sell products online with optimized product pages, cart flows, and post-purchase retention.

## Flow

```
Ad / Organic → Product Page → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order Bump → Upsell → Thank You
```

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Product Page | Hero imagery, benefits, social proof, ATC |
| Cart / Side Drawer | Review items, cross-sells |
| Checkout | Streamlined payment capture |
| Order Bump | Add-on at checkout (+$X) |
| Post-Purchase Upsell | One-click additional offer |
| Thank You + Tracking | Confirm order, set expectations |

## Product Page Anatomy

### Above the Fold
- **Product images** (3–5, lifestyle + close-up, video if possible)
- **Product title** (clear + keyword-rich)
- **Price** (original crossed out if on sale)
- **Star rating** + review count
- **Key benefit bullets** (3–5)
- **Add to Cart button** (high contrast, full-width on mobile)
- **Trust badges** (shipping, guarantee, secure checkout)

### Below the Fold
- **Detailed description** (benefits, not just specs)
- **Size guide / usage instructions**
- **Customer reviews** with photos
- **Comparison table** (vs. competitors or alternatives)
- **FAQ**
- **Related products** / "Customers also bought"

## Cart Optimization
- **Side-drawer cart** (don't redirect to cart page)
- **Free shipping threshold** — "Add $12 more for free shipping"
- **Cross-sell widget** — "Complete the look" / "Frequently bought together"
- **Urgency** — "In your cart for 15 minutes" or low stock alerts
- **Express checkout** — Apple Pay, Google Pay, Shop Pay

## Post-Purchase Upsell
```
"Wait — add {{UPSELL_PRODUCT}} for just ${{PRICE}}?"
[Yes, Add to My Order]  ←  One-click (no re-entering payment)
[No thanks, just my order]
```

## Conversion Benchmarks

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Product page → ATC | > 8% |
| ATC → checkout | > 50% |
| Checkout → purchase | > 65% |
| Cart abandonment recovery | > 10% |
| Order bump take rate | > 20% |
| Post-purchase upsell | > 12% |
| Avg order value lift (with bumps) | > 25% |

## Cart Abandonment Email Sequence

| Email | Timing | Subject |
|---|---|---|
| Reminder | +1 hour | "You left something behind 👀" |
| Social Proof | +24 hours | "Why [X] customers love {{Product}}" |
| Discount | +48 hours | "Still thinking? Here's 10% off" |
| Final | +72 hours | "Last chance — your cart expires" |

## Key Principles
1. **Reduce clicks to purchase** — every extra step loses 20% of buyers
2. **Mobile-first** — 70%+ of e-commerce traffic is mobile
3. **Trust badges everywhere** — especially near payment buttons
4. **Real photography** — avoid stock; lifestyle imagery converts better
5. **Social proof density** — reviews, UGC, "bestseller" badges

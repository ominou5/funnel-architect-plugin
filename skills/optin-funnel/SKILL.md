# Opt-In Funnel

The simplest and most common funnel type. Two pages: a squeeze page and a thank-you page.

## Funnel Flow

```
Traffic → Squeeze Page → Thank You Page
              │                │
         [Email Form]    [Deliver Lead Magnet]
                              [Upsell / Next Step]
```

## Pages

### Page 1: Squeeze Page

**Purpose:** Capture the visitor's email in exchange for a lead magnet.

**Required Elements:**
1. **Headline** — Benefit-driven, focused on the lead magnet value
2. **Sub-headline** — Specificity about what they'll get
3. **Lead magnet visual** — Image/mockup of the PDF, checklist, etc.
4. **3–5 bullet points** — What's inside the lead magnet
5. **Opt-in form** — Email field + CTA button (name field optional)
6. **Social proof** — Number of subscribers or a mini-testimonial
7. **Privacy line** — "We respect your privacy. Unsubscribe anytime."

**CTA Examples:**
- "Get My Free [Lead Magnet Name] →"
- "Download the [Number]-Step [Topic] Now"
- "Send Me the Free Guide"
- "Yes, I Want the Checklist!"

**What to REMOVE:**
- Navigation menu (no escape routes)
- Multiple CTAs competing for attention
- Long-form copy (this is a squeeze page, not a sales page)
- Pricing or payment-related content

### Page 2: Thank You Page

**Purpose:** Deliver the lead magnet and introduce the next step.

**Required Elements:**
1. **Confirmation message** — "Check your email for [Lead Magnet]"
2. **Inline delivery** — Direct download link (don't rely solely on email)
3. **Next step CTA** — Introduce a related offer, webinar, or content
4. **Social share buttons** — "Share this with a friend who needs it"

**Optional upsells:**
- Low-ticket offer ($7–$27 tripwire)
- Webinar registration
- Free trial of main product
- Join a community/group

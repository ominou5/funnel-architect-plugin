# Product Launch Funnel

Build anticipation over days/weeks with free value content, then open cart for a limited window.

## Flow

```
Opt-In → PLC Video 1 → PLC Video 2 → PLC Video 3 → Cart Open (Sales Page) → Cart Close
```

| Page | Purpose | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| Opt-In / Waitlist | Capture leads, build the launch list | 2–4 weeks before launch |
| PLC 1: The Opportunity | Show the gap / opportunity | Day 1 of launch |
| PLC 2: The Transformation | Teach a concept, prove credibility | Day 3–4 |
| PLC 3: The Blueprint | Give actionable framework, seed the offer | Day 6–7 |
| Sales Page | Full offer with cart open | Day 8–10 |
| Cart Close | Final urgency push | Day 12–14 |

## PLC Video Page Requirements
- **Video** (15–30 min, educational + story)
- **Key takeaways** listed below video
- **Comment section** or engagement CTA ("Reply and tell us…")
- **Countdown** to next video or cart open
- **Social share** buttons

## Email Sequence

| Email | Timing | Subject Line Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Welcome | Immediately after opt-in | "You're in! Here's what's coming…" |
| PLC 1 Launch | Day 1 | "Video 1 is live: [Curiosity hook]" |
| PLC 1 Reminder | Day 2 | "Did you catch this?" |

## Conversion Benchmarks

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Landing → opt-in | > 35% |
| Opt-in → watch PLC 1 | > 60% |
| Watch PLC 1 → watch PLC 3 | > 30% |
| Watch PLC 3 → sales page | > 40% |

## Key Principles
1. **Give your best stuff free** — the PLC content should be genuinely valuable
2. **Mental triggers**: reciprocity, authority, social proof, scarcity, community
3. **Seed the offer** in every PLC — mention it's coming, don't hide it
4. **Hard cart close** — the deadline must be real
5. **Sideways sales letter** — the 3 videos ARE the sales pitch, spread across days

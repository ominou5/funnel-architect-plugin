# Funnel Strategy

Before building anything, define the strategy. A funnel without strategy is just a collection of pages.

## Discovery Questions

Ask the user these questions (skip any they've already answered):

### 1. Business Model
- What are you selling? (Product, service, course, SaaS, membership, etc.)
- What is the price point? (Determines funnel complexity)
  - **< $50** → Simple opt-in or tripwire funnel
  - **$50–$500** → Direct response or webinar funnel
  - **$500–$2,000** → Webinar or challenge funnel
  - **$2,000+** → Application funnel or multi-step sales process

### 2. Target Audience
- Who is your ideal customer? (Demographics, psychographics)
- What is their #1 pain point?
- What have they tried before that didn't work?
- What would success look like for them?

### 3. Traffic Source
- Where will traffic come from?
  - **Paid ads** (Facebook, Google, YouTube) → Need strong above-the-fold hook
  - **Organic/SEO** → Need content-rich pages with SEO optimization
  - **Social media** → Need share-friendly design and social proof
  - **Email list** → Can be more direct with the offer
  - **Affiliate/JV** → Need strong affiliate tools page

### 4. Conversion Goal
- What is the primary action you want visitors to take?
  - Email opt-in → Lead gen funnel
  - Purchase → Sales funnel
  - Book a call → Application funnel
  - Register for event → Webinar/challenge funnel
  - Start free trial → SaaS funnel

### 5. Assets Available
- Do you have existing copy, testimonials, case studies?
- Do you have brand guidelines (colors, fonts, logos)?
- Do you have product images or videos?
- Do you have an existing email provider?

## Strategy Output

After discovery, produce a **Funnel Blueprint** with:

```

```

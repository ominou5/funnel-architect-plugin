[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A comprehensive Claude Code plugin for building high-converting sales funnels. Strategy, design, copy, deployment, and optimization — all inside your editor. v 1.0.0 - Warning: There are bound to be issues as it's just been released! Please follow our contributing, security rules, and get me here if you need help or want to discuss: https://www.skool.com/agashic-5136

## What It Does

Tell Claude what you're selling and who you're selling to. Funnel Architect handles the rest:

- **Picks the right funnel type** for your product and price point
- **Generates production-ready pages** (HTML/CSS, React, Next.js, or Astro)
- **Writes conversion copy** using proven frameworks (AIDA, PAS, StoryBrand)
- **Optimizes for speed** (Core Web Vitals, lazy loading, critical CSS)
- **Deploys anywhere** (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages)
- **Connects your stack** (email, payments, CRM, analytics)

## Why Funnel Architect?

| Hire a copywriter or wing it | 5 specialist agents write, review, and optimize copy |
| Hope your pages load fast | Automated Lighthouse audits and mobile checks on every save |
| Deploy manually | One command to Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare |

**Who it's for**: Creators, SaaS founders, coaches, and marketers who want to ship funnels fast without leaving their editor.

## Automated Hooks

The plugin runs checks automatically as you build:

- **Mobile Check** (PostToolUse) — validates viewport, touch targets, and fixed widths after every file write ⚠️ *Currently bash-only; Node.js rewrite in progress for Windows/cross-platform support*
- **Lighthouse Audit** (PostToolUse, async) — runs performance analysis in the background
- **Funnel Validation** (Stop) — checks link integrity and structure before completing a session

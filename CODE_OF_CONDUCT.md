# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to be cool, if you are cool. It's that simple.

## Our Standards

**Cool:**

- Using chill language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Uncool:**

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [@samrexford](https://x.com/samrexford). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
